# Roadmap-day3-task-JavaScript-Day3

Dear Sir,

Please note in this script.js will provide results in console, below listed results we can see in console.

 Task question 1) How to compate two JSON have the same properties without order? 
                   a. let obj1 = {name: "Person 1", age:5};
                   b. let obj2 = {age:5, name: "Person 1"};
                Output result is false, because in JavaScript code we have used === to compare both object.
                
 Task question 2) Use the rest countries API URL and display all countries flags in the console.

                in console we can see the every country flag URL. for easy identification before added country name.
                
  Task question 3) Use the same rest countries and print all countries names, regions, sub-region and populations.

                in console we can see the all countries names. regions, sub-region and populations.


  Thank you for reading this file and seeing console results.
